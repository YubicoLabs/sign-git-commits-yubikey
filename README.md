# sign-git-commits-yubikey
Sign git commits with a YubiKey

Note: This approach uses a YubiKey to store your master certify key. There are many ways to ultimately achieve your end goal. Each has their own strengths and weaknesses. Do your own research and pick the appropriate strategy for your specific requirements.

This guide will walk you through how to generate GPG keys that are good for general use, including encryption and code signing. All keys are generated and stored on YubiKeys. One will be your “master key” - protect it as if it were your actual identity. The other will contain sub-keys that you will use for your day to day use.

# Overview of steps
* Install and configure necessary software
* Set up “master” YubiKey for safekeeping
    * Configure PIN/Admin PIN
    * Generate master key
* Set up “developer” YubiKey for every day use
    * Configure PIN/Admin PIN
    * Generate developer keys (making use of the first YubiKey)
* Adding a new GPG key to your GitHub account
* Setup git to sign commits and tags
* Signing commits
* Verifying commits
* Signing tags
* Verifying tags
* Merging and pushing

# Introduction to OpenPGP
OpenPGP is a standard for using cryptographic keys for various uses. The main implementation of this standard is the GNU Privacy Guard (gnupg) software. In OpenPGP an individual has an "OpenPGP key", which is actually a set of public-private key pairs grouped together under a master key. The master key is the main key pair. Other key pairs are known as subkeys, and any sub-key belonging to the "OpenPGP key" will be signed by the master key. In addition to the master key, it is common to have 3 sub-keys with different usage:

**Signature key** - Used for signing git commits, files, e-mails, etc. to prove that they came from you.

**Encryption key** - Used to encrypt/decrypt stuff like files or e-mails so that only you can see them.

**Authentication key** - Used to authenticate things like an SSH session.

The master key itself signs your own sub-keys, as well as other people's public keys, which is used to indicate that you’ve verified the identity of the key holder. Your master key is also used to extend the expiration date of your own OpenPGP key.

The YubiKey can store 3 key pairs in the OpenPGP application. Typical use will have each of the three sub-keys (Signature, Encryption, and Authentication) on a single YubiKey.

# Prerequisites
## Hardware
You will need two YubiKey 5 series. USB A or C does not matter, and should be determined by what ports you have readily available on your computer. Nano form factor is not recommended as you should always unplug your development key when it is not in use.
## Software
What you need depends on your operating system.
### Linux
Install the following packages via your distribution’s package manager:
* GPG
* pcscd
* YubiKey Manager
For example, on apt based distributions like Ubuntu or Debian:
```
$ sudo apt install pcscd gnupg2
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:yubico/stable
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install yubikey-manager
```
### Windows
**YubiKey Manager**

Download the latest version directly from https://www.yubico.com/

**GPG4Win**

Install GPG4Win from https://www.gpg4win.org/download.html - the default settings are fine.

### macOS
**YubiKey Manager**
* Download the latest version directly from https://www.yubico.com/

**GnuPG**

The easiest way to install GnuPG on macOS is using Homebrew:

Note: The latest version of GnuPG (3.2.1 at the time of writing) on Homebrew works fine.
```
$ brew install gnupg
```

**Pinentry**

It’s recommended to install the graphical pinentry program for macOS. 
```
$ brew install pinentry-mac
```
Add to your ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf file:
```
pinentry-program /usr/local/bin/pinentry-mac
```
Add to your ~/.gnupg/scdaemon.conf file:

`disable-ccid` (From the man page: Disable the integrated support for CCID compliant readers. This allows falling back to one of the other drivers even if the internal CCID driver can handle the reader.)

# Generate your master key
This key is not intended for everyday use, it will be used to generate the keys you use day to day. The Yubikey storing it is typically kept in a safe place in between key generations.
From your operating system’s native terminal window, run the following set of commands:
 
Note: If you get a ‘command not found’ or similar error when attempting to run ‘gpg’, make sure that the executable is defined in your environment’s PATH variable.

Warning: GPG does not handle multiple smart cards well. Make sure you only have one YubiKey plugged in at a time, and you have no other smart card reader devices visible on your computer.
```
$ gpg --card-edit

## Generate your master certify key
### Changing to better defaults
We want to make sure we’re using the strongest key types that are available for GPG. For our purposes, we need to use RSA keys for all key types. Set the key size to the maximum supported by the YubiKey (4096 bits).
```
gpg/card> key-attr
Changing card key attribute for: Signature key
Please select what kind of key you want:
   (1) RSA
   (2) ECC

What keysize do you want? (2048) 4096
The card will now be re-configured to generate a key of 4096 bits
Changing card key attribute for: Encryption key
Please select what kind of key you want:
   (1) RSA
   (2) ECC
Your selection? 1
What keysize do you want? (2048) 4096

   (2) ECC
Your selection? 1
What keysize do you want? (2048) 4096
The card will now be re-configured to generate a key of 4096 bits
```
### Key creation
Now we should create our master certify key. Be sure to add your name and email address as this is used to identify your key.

Warning: When you type 'O' for (O)kay, the YubiKey will begin to generate the keys. This command can take 4-5 minutes. GPG will not give any feedback until this process has completed. Please be patient!
```
gpg/card> generate
Make off-card backup of encryption key? (Y/n) n

Please note that the factory settings of the PINs are
   PIN = '123456'     Admin PIN = '12345678'
You should change them using the command --change-pin

Please specify how long the key should be valid.
         0 = key does not expire
      <n>  = key expires in n days
      <n>w = key expires in n weeks
      <n>m = key expires in n months
      <n>y = key expires in n years
Key is valid for? (0)
Key does not expire at all
Is this correct? (y/N) y

GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.

Real name: You
Name must be at least 5 characters long
Real name: You McEngineer
Email address: you@example.com
Comment:
You selected this USER-ID:
    "You McEngineer <you@example.com>"

### Trim the excess from your master key
Our master key should really only ever be used for certification of our sub-keys and for signing public keys that we trust. We can, and should, get rid of the encryption and authentication keys as they should not be used in day to day operations.

# Generate your development sub keys
Now we’ll work on creating the GPG keys that you’ll use on a day-to-day basis. This will utilize the second YubiKey you have - but don’t put away your master key yet! We’re still going to need it to generate your sub keys.

Insert the YubiKey that you want to use as your development key.

Before running the following steps, you should edit the GPG card like you did with the first yubikey and change the PINs (Section Setting your PIN, Admin PIN, and Reset Code) and change key-len defaults (Section Changing to better defaults). Note that these PINs should be different from the PINs used for your master key.

Once that’s out of the way, let’s get started!

Determine the key handle for your signing key. This is the hexadecimal number on the line designated [S] above (B4E1273375AC2412).

## Configure git
Next, instruct Git that you want to use this key for signing:
```
git config --global user.signingKey B4E1273375AC2412
```
Consider turning auto signing on:
```
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
```
Otherwise, you will need to specify -S as an extra command line argument to git commit.

You will sometimes need to specify which GPG executable Git should use.

**Linux**
```
> git config --global gpg.program gpg2
```
**Windows**
```
> git config --global gpg.program "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\GnuPG\\bin\\gpg.exe"
```
**macOS**
```
> git config --global gpg.program gpg
```

# Signing commits
From a security standpoint, by default, Git doesn’t provide any assurance of authorship. Although every Git "blob" is hashed using SHA-1, this is only useful as an integrity check, i.e., to guarantee that the files and the commits that you are working with, are the exact same things they were when they were first created.

Git does provide the ability to sign your work. This allows users to verify that data is coming from a trusted source. Use the `-S` switch to sign your commits
```
git commit -S -m 'Fixed a small undocumented feature that made foo crash'
```

You will be prompted for your User PIN and the signed commit will be created. Note that the command shown above uses the capital letter S (the extended form would be `--gpg-sign`). Using the lowercase letter s will only include the text `Signed-off-by: Committer Name <committer@example.com>` in your commit message and **not** actually sign the commit.

To display the signature of the last commit you can use
```
git cat-file -p HEAD
tree c09dec94a1b2f8c4792fd0faef35623e0463fc73
parent 3fe8b3b4b9394678aeadfa4113e8982802f759f8

# Verifying commits
Signed commits can be verified in many different places. One way is to manually display the commit.
```
$ git show HEAD --show-signature

commit 552b36ec86790bfdac679ab23e6d61133ff0b383
gpg: Signature made Sat 22 Feb 2014 11:00:00 CEST using RSA key ID AABBCCDD
gpg: Good signature from "Committer Name <committer@example.com>"
Author: Committer Name <committer@example.com>
Date:   Sat Feb 22 11:00:00 2014 +0200

    Fixed a small undocumented feature that made foo crash
```

GPG has to have the public key of the signer to successfully verify the signature.

The previous command assumes that the commit of interest was the very last one. To verify a generic commit replace HEAD with the commit ID (`552b36ec86790bfdac679ab23e6d61133ff0b383` in this case).

Alternative commands to verify commit signatures are
```
git log --show-signature # Displays all commits and verify signed ones
```
```
git verify-commit HEAD # Displays and verify the latest commit
```

# Signing tags
Tags are another one of the things that can be signed with Git. To do so you can use the `-s` switch
```
git tag foo-1.0 -s -m 'Release 1.0 of Foo'
 ```
After issuing the command, you will be prompted for your GPG User PIN and a signed tag will be created. You can check the result of this operation by running the following command
```
git show foo-1.0

tag foo-1.0
Tagger: Committer Name <committer@example.com>
Date:   Sat Feb 22 10:30:00 2014 +0200

Release 1.0 of Foo

-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----
 ```

A similar output can also be achieved with the command
```
git cat-file -p foo-1.0
```

or with the command
```
git verify-tag foo-1.0
```

# Verifying tags
Once a tag has been signed, it is possible to ask Git to verify a signature for us. This is done by using the `-v` switch on the tag we want to verify
```
git tag -v foo-1.0

object 3fe8b3b4b9394678aeadfa4113e8982802f759f8
type commit
tag foo-1.0
tagger Committer Name <committer@example.com> 1393230600 +0200

Release 1.0 of Foo
gpg: Signature made Sat Feb 22 10:30:00 2014 CEST using RSA key ID AABBCCDD
gpg: Good signature from "Committer Name <committer@example.com>"
 ```

Keep in mind that, behind the scenes, this is invoking GPG which, in order to verify the signature for you, should be informed of who is the owner of key ID `AABBCCDD` by importing their public key. If this information is missing, you will receive an error message.

# Merging and Pushing
When merging branches or tags, it is possible to ask Git to verify the signature of the commits being merged. This is done with
```
git merge --verify-signatures other_branch
 ```

If the signatures can not be verified, the merge will be aborted.
Similarly, the `-S` switch can be used to sign the commit resulting from a merge.

Also, if you created annotated tags, when you merge them Git will create a new commit for you. During this process it will also verify the involved signatures and include the verification output in the comment of the commit message.

Since Git version 2.2.0 it is also possible to sign git pushes by doing `git push --signed`. This is used to prove the intention the author had of pushing a specific set of commits and have them become the new tip of some branch.
